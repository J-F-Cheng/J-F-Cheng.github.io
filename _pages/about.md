I have been a PhD student in Imperial College London since 2022, under the supervision of Dr Tania Stathaki.

My research interests encompass 3D vision, robotics, and generative models. Outside of scientific research, I am also passionate about musical composition. You can listen to my musical compositions on my [NetEase Cloud Music channel](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=48569965).
